This project is my work on the Skillshare [Node Masterclass](https://www.skillshare.com/classes/The-Node-js-Master-Class-No-Frameworks-No-NPM-No-Dependencies/187976462) Course. The purpose is to build a Node.js server with no frameworks, packages, or external dependencies. I have also do some work in refactoring some of the modules to incorporate more modern Node practices such as promises and async/await since the course is based on Node 8, which is deprecated.
